# 🕵️ Murder Mystery - Can You Solve the Case?
Welcome to my terminal-based murder mystery game, where your eyes might get tired chasing clues in the shadows, but the suspense? That never quits.

I built this game in Java to put my object-oriented programming knowledge into action, with concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction and more. To keep things clean and scalable, I ensured that everything was structured around the SOLID principles.  

• Single Responsibility ----> Every class has one cause to change.  
• Open/Closed           ---->  The code is easy to extend with new features, without modification of existing classes.  
• Liskov Substitution   ----> Subtypes are replaced by basetypes.   
• Interface Segregation ---->  Every class implements a specific interface without unnecessary behaviours.   
• Dependency Inversion  ---->  Abstract classes are created to avoid dependence on concrete classes.

# Why I made this Game? 
I’ve always been a fan of riddles and clue-based games as they’ve made me curious about what’s really happening behind the scenes. So when I started learning programming, I knew I had to build this game. Also, I’ve  always enjoyed storytelling and this project gave me the chance to bring both together. This game is everything I’ve learned so far in programming with twists, logic, and a murder mystery storyline.

# 🔍 Game Description
- As a player, you step into the shoes of a detective who is tasked with solving a mysterious murder case that took place inside a grand mansion🏰🔪🩸  
- The game starts in the main hallway, and from there, you can explore any of the following rooms:
